Phonegap-Example
================

This is a very basic example of how to use apiOmat in a Phonegap project.

How to use:

Follow the first steps of our Phonegap Quickstart guide to set up the backend and download the SDK. Copy the apiomat.js from the SDK into the www/lib folder.
After installing the Android SDK and Phonegap you can go to the directory containing this project (parent folder of www) and run the following commands:

* cordova platform add android
* cordova build
* cordova emulate android

With other SDKs you can use other platforms. Read the Phonegap documentation for further details.
